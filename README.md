# mapbox-angular-tutorial
 Sourcecode for my article on medium "Creating a Simple Mapbox Component in Angular". This repo contains 2 separate Angular applications both have the necessarry packages in the package.json file needed to complete the tutorial. To use this code you'll need to have installed Node.js and then Angular CLI. 

At the time of creation my Node, Angular and NPM versions were:
- Angular CLI: 15.2.0
- Node: 14.20.0
- Package Manager: npm 6.14.17
 
**mapbox-angular-basic**:

This is the basic Angular application structure that you need to get started so be sure to `cd mapbox-angular-basic` this folder when following the tutorial 
- Use `npm i` to install all angular and mapbox dependencies
- use `ng serve` to run the application by default this should load in http://localhost:4200/



**mapbox-angular-final**:

This is the sourcecode for the final product of the tutorial - you can use this as reference in case you get a bit lost trying to follow the article, or simply you can take this code as a template for a working Mapbox Angular Web component

To run the sourcecode
- Make sure you are working in the correct folder `cd mapbox-angular-final`
- Use `npm i` to install all angular and mapbox dependencies
- Use `ng serve` to run the application by default this should load in http://localhost:4200/

This code is free to take and do with as you please, feel free to suggest any changes to the sourcecode should you feel there is room for improvement.

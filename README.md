# mapbox-angular-tutorial
 Sourcecode for my article on medium "Creating a Simple Mapbox Component in Angular". This repo contains 2 separate Angular applications
 
**mapbox-angular-basic**:
This is the basic Angular application structure that you need to get started so be sure to `cd mapbox-angular-basic` this folder when following the tutorial 
Use `npm i` to install all angular and mapbox dependencies
use `ng serve` to run the application by default this should load in http://localhost:4200/

**mapbox-angular-final**:
This is the sourcecode for the final product of the tutorial - you can use this as reference in case you get a bit lost trying to follow the article, or simply you can take this code as a template for a working Mapbox Angular Web component

To run the sourcecode
- Make sure you are working in the correct folder `cd mapbox-angular-final`
- Use `npm i` to install all angular and mapbox dependencies
- Use `ng serve` to run the application by default this should load in http://localhost:4200/

This code is free to take and do with as you please, feel free to suggest any changes to the sourcecode should you feel there is room for improvement.
